# OKCupid

Dating apps have become increasingly popular in recent years for finding love. A number of these apps make use of data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. Through these apps, we can gain access to a wealth of information about how people experience romance differently.

OKCupid is a dating app developed by Dating Agency that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users. As a data scientist in Dating Agency, the goal of this project is uncover insights from the dataset and build a model with an ROC AUC score > 0.90 to predict whether an OKCupid user drinks or smokes or uses drug.
